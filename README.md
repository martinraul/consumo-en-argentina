# Historia del Consumo en Argentina
A React made digital companion for my final thesis teaching at the course "Historia Argentina II". (View MASTER branch for entire project)

**About Consumption Studies**

> In the last few decades researchers have increasingly situated practices of consumption and a consumerist ethic as central for understanding broader social and cultural change.

> Consumption involves not just purchasing or using a good or service but also selecting it, maintaining it, possibly repairing it, and ultimately, disposing of it in some way. Within each of these stages there are a number of complex subprocesses that consumption studies scholars have increasingly paid attention to.
